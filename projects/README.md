# Projects

This project area is a small, focused workflow on suggesting projects, and discussing current projects.

## Proposing a new Project

Project documents do not need to be complex. Strive for clarity, not detail. Try to cover the following:

* What is the goal of this Project?
* Who is committed to this Project?
* What is our guess for the timeframe?
* How will the team communicate?

Include any extra information that will add clarity, don't include sections that don't make sense.

Draft up a Markdown document, then submit it as a pull request to this repository for discussion.
